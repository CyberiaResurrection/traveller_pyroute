"""
Restarted single-source all-target Dijkstra shortest paths.

Lifted from networkx repo (https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/main/networkx/algorithms/shortest_paths/weighted.py)
as at Add note about using latex formatting in docstring in the contributorâ€¦  (commit a63c8bd).

Major modifications here are ripping out gubbins unrelated to the single-source all-targets case, handling cases
where less than the entire shortest path tree needs to be regenerated due to a link weight change, and specialising to
the specific input format used in PyRoute.
